In this project, we reproduced and evaluated site-specific regression models originally developed by the 
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to predict concentrations of \textit{Escherichia coli} (E. coli) at recreational beaches on the Great Lakes in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Using the CSVs provided by the USGS (calibration data and 2019 validation files), we built two regression models in Python with the scikit-learn library, using water quality and environmental data from the USGS. While our reproduced models did not perfectly match the official USGS models, they demonstrated similar trends and still captured the essential relationships between environmental predictors and E. coli concentrations, with our best models achieving $R^{2}$ scores of 0.476 and 0.556.
