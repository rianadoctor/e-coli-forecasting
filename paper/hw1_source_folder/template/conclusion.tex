\label{sec:concl}

Overall, we successfully reproduced USGS regression models to predict E. coli at Great Lakes beaches. Our Ridge models captured key predictor relationships and closely matched original coefficient patterns, though validation showed reduced generalization. These results highlight the models’ usefulness for rapid water-quality estimation while emphasizing the need for ongoing recalibration and monitoring under changing conditions.
