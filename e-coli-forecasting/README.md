## Ridge Regression Models: Beach 6 and Huntington

## Summary
This repository contains two Ridge regression models for predicting E. coli at Beach 6 and Huntington. Both models can be run through Jupyter Notebooks.

## How to run the code
1. Place the calibration data and validation datasets for both beaches in the same workspace as the models folder. 
2. Run the cells in order, from the top. 
3. No arguments or parameters need to be changed. The Ridge models are already fitted with the optimal alpha found with GridSearch.

## Optional Components
- **CSV Output:** You can generate a CSV file that contains observed/actual vs predicted values, but it's not necessary and can be skipped.
- **`data_exploration` Folder:** This folder contains a Python file that generates preprocessed data. Running it is not necessary.
